**Prompt: Final system-level technical document**

```text
You are a principal architect documenting the entire system.

Using everything you can infer from the code, READMEs, and project structure, generate a single, consolidated **System Technical Document** in Markdown with the following structure:

# 1. System Overview
- Business context
- High-level description of what this system does
- Primary stakeholders and consumers

# 2. Domain & Bounded Contexts
- Identify major domains or bounded contexts (if visible)
- Map modules/services to these domains

# 3. Architecture Overview
- Overall style (microservices, layered, modular monolith, etc.)
- How modules/services interact
- Synchronous vs asynchronous communication
- External systems / integrations

# 4. Module / Service Catalog
For each module:
- Name
- Responsibilities
- Key APIs / entry points
- Data it reads/writes
- Dependencies

# 5. Key Flows
Pick 2–3 critical end-to-end flows (e.g., “Create X”, “Update Y”, “Process Z”):
- Describe the steps across services
- Note the relevant APIs, services, and data stores
- Mention error handling at a high level

# 6. Data & Persistence
- Main data stores and their roles
- Important entities/collections/tables
- Relationships between key data models

# 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Authentication & authorization
- Logging, tracing, auditing
- Configuration management
- Caching, performance considerations

# 8. Operational Aspects
- Deployment assumptions (containers, cloud, etc.)
- Environments (dev, test, prod)
- Monitoring & alerting hints (infer from code/logging if possible)

# 9. Risks, Constraints & Tech Debt
- Assumptions and constraints visible in code
- Known or likely tech debt areas
- Suggestions for future refactors or improvements

Use only information you can infer from the repository. Be explicit when you are making a reasonable assumption.
Output must be valid Markdown.

# 10. create document in document folder inside root folder of project




-----------------------------

You are a system architect.

From the perspective of the entire repository:

1. Identify:
   - All main modules/services
   - External clients (UI, mobile, other systems)
   - External dependencies (databases, queues, 3rd party APIs)
   - Key communication paths between modules

2. Generate two diagrams in Mermaid:

### A. System Context Diagram
Show:
- Primary users/clients
- This system (and sub-systems if applicable)
- External systems and integrations

Use a `flowchart TD` Mermaid diagram.

### B. Container / Service Diagram
Show:
- Each container/service/module in this repository
- Data stores
- External systems
- Arrows showing direction of calls or data flow

Use a `flowchart LR` or C4-style Mermaid diagram.

3. Add a short “Architect’s Notes” section explaining:
- Key design decisions you can infer
- Where the system is tightly or loosely coupled
- Any potential risks or hotspots

Output a single Markdown document. Diagrams must be wrapped in ```mermaid fenced blocks.

4. create document in document folder inside root folder of project
